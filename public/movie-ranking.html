<h1>The best movies according to Daniel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Casino Royale (James Bond 007)</h3>
<p>
  Best dialogue (arguments) between JB and Bond girl in the train about the
  other's habit, character, presumable family background and heritage. Another
  argument when the Bond girl is taking the hotel elevator, rejecting JB to join
  her in saying: "There is not enough room inside here for both me and your
  ego."
</p>
<h3>Jesus of Montreal</h3>
<p>

  The film tells the story of a group of actors in Montreal who perform a
  Passion play in a Quebec church (the film uses the grounds of Saint Joseph's
  Oratory on Mount Royal), combining religious belief with unconventional
  theories on a historical Jesus. As the church turns against the main actor and
  author of the play, his life increasingly mirrors the story of Jesus, and the
  film adapts numerous stories from the New Testament.

<h3>What happens in Vegas</h3>
<p>
  source: wikipedia: <br />
  It stars Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher as a couple who get married and win a
  casino jackpot prize during a drunken night in Las Vegas, but their simple
  plan to get a quick divorce and divide the money is complicated by the divorce
  court judge's ruling.
